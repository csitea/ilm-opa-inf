# ==================================================================================
# This file handles the dependencies of every terraform step.
# When provisioning, read top-down, when divesting read bottom-up.
#
# [WARNING] ::: This file do not handle external dependencies. If you added a bucket
#               in 015-s3-buckets or a certificate in 007-dns, you'll need to keep
#               track of the soft dependencies yourself.

# [The basic block ] ===============================================================
# This step is so fundamental that we cannot work without it. It is in a
# state where it does not need adjustments and we can safely assume that
# it always exists and never needs to be re-provisioned.
002-aws-accounts:

# SCPs are provisioned earlier in the process, but do not become a dependency
# of other steps, since we can reprovision this anytime.
003-aws-scps:

# Can be reapplied anytime to fix role permissions and credentials syncing
004-aws-iam:

# Will be constantly reprovisioned to add/edit users.
006-individual-users:

# Will be constantly reprovisioned to add/edit dns entries and/or certificates
007-dns:

# Whenever a new ECR is needed
008-ecr:

# Whenever a new bucket is needed
